                    <p>Focus less on growing subscriber count, more on engagement, dialogue, and respect for readers. Word-of-mouth comes from engaged readers, not big lists.</p>

                    <h3>It's an Absolute Grind</h3>
                    <p>Unless you're an established name, building a newsletter requires constant, consistent production over a long period. No overnight success. But owning your platform beats the alternatives.</p>

                    <h3>People Underestimate the Hustle</h3>
                    <p>It's a lot of work and can feel very solo. Not "start writing and money rolls in." It's a constant beast to feed, but make it work for you — you don't work for it.</p>

                    <p>A newsletter isn't a beat you can change easily — it's a product. Once readers come for a specific interest, it's difficult to move away from it.</p>

                        <strong>⚠️ Critical:</strong>
                        Be intentional about what you want to spend a significant chunk of your career covering. You'll be locked into this topic for years.

                    <h3>It's a Sales Business, Not Content Business</h3>
                    <p>With advertising model, monetizing is the hard part. It's just grinding: sending emails, talking to people, getting better at sales. 20-22 ad slots/month to fill — it never ends.</p>
                    <div class="critical-box">
                        <strong>Reality:</strong>
                        Most newsletters won't go from zero to $500k in sales in 6 months. Takes a long time to figure out monetization.

                    <p>As traffic from search and social has dried up over past 5 years, it's strikingly clear how important it is to own your audience and create value specifically in newsletter form.</p>

                        Not taking newsletters seriously as a platform earlier. Started as just "come to my book reading" updates, should have focused on creating value sooner.
